Here is a SQL query with a common table expression: 

### I created a CTE named top_customer_cte to identify the top 5 customers who have paid the highest total amounts.

WITH top_customers_cte AS ( 
  SELECT B.customer_id,
    B.first_name,
    B.last_name,
    E.country,
    D.city,
    SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
  FROM payment A
  JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
  JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id 
  WHERE D.city IN (
    SELECT D.city
    FROM customer B
    INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
    INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_ID = E.country_ID WHERE E.country IN (
      SELECT E.country
      FROM customer B
      INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
      INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_ID = E.country_ID GROUP BY E.country
      ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC
      LIMIT 10
    )
    GROUP BY E.country, D.city
    ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC 
    LIMIT 10
  )
  GROUP BY B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, D.city 
  ORDER BY SUM(A.amount) DESC
  LIMIT 5
  )
SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS average 
FROM top_customers_cte;
