Here is a SQL query that is joining tables of Data

Top 10 Countries for Rockbuster in terms of customer numbers:

SELECT D.country,
  COUNT(customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY number_of_customers DESC
LIMIT 10



Explanation 
The data that I want is stored in the customer and country tables. 
However, these tables aren’t directly connected, so I’ll need to join the customer table with the address table, the address table with the city table, and finally the city table with the country table to get the relevant information. 
I used the INNER JOIN because we only need to extract some information of the tables. Also, to have the top 10 I add the limit 10.
